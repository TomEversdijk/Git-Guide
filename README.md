## What is git?
Git is a VCS (Version control system) which is used for two main purposes:
1. To store a back-up of your work in case something goes wrong.
2. To work with multiple developers on the same project without destroying others work.

## Installation
You start by downloading and [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for your operating system: 

Verify that you've installed git correctly by open a command line and type the following command. If everything is installend 
```bash
